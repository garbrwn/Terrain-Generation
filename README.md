# Terrain-Generation

Mesh Terrain Generation in Unity.

A small, work in progress project, using [Auburn's Fast Noise Lite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) to build mesh terrains in Unity from fractal noise.
Currently it will just generate a single tile, at a maximum size of 256x256 (65,536) vertices before reaching Unity's mesh size limit.

- [ ] Mesh Tiling

- [ ] Import/Export
- [ ] Heat Mapping
- [ ] Humidity Mapping
- [ ] Biomes
